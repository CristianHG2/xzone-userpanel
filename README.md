PHP code from a decade ago, it's been a long journey.

Wrote this back when I used to play SA-MP, a community I have much to be thankful for as it was there that I really got to spread my coding wings. A lot of emotional value behind this code, so much so that it's code I love to look at, even if it's ugly, non-standard, or hacky.

Felt that it would be awesome to add it to my GH repo list as a constant reminder of where I started :')
